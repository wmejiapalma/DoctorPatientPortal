# Doctor Patient Portal better known as **PokeDocc**
This was a project for my College Capstone in which we had 10 weeks to create an entire public application from scratch.
- This application needed to be deployed and be accessed on a public url for everyone to test.
- This contained different languages/technologies I had to learn from scratch (ex: React, flask, and more)

Designed to be a showcase of what I learned in 2 years from Neumont College of Computer Science, this application has many tech features
1. Dockerization with 1 Click deployment
2. AWS integration
3. My own User Authentication
4. Security features to prevent access to data
5. and more!

Thank you for reading me! This is one of my favorite projects I've ever made :)
